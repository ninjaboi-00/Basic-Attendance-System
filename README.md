# Basic-Attendance-System

I made this project to learn more how to understand coding. 

This is a basic attendance system with text files as its database. The program will automatically create text files and directories if they do not exist.
It includes functionalities including profiles, time in / time out, and checking attendance records of the users.

The design is not yet finalized but it shall be improved in the next version! :>
